\b Description:
\b0 \
\
This application demonstrates hardware accelerated view capture pipeline from a view and saving the results as files using Image I/O.  The contents are 3D animated objects generated using OpenGL, and captured as a snapshot using pixel buffer objects.  The images can then be saved as tiff, pdf, bmp, pict, png, gif, jpeg, or jp2 files using Image I/O.  The application also manages and stores properties of OpenGL shader uniforms and image file authoring preferences.\
